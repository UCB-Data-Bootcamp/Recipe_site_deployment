Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost.

GREAT for company because it is so easy and yet taste wonderful! I cook this in the microwave, but I'm sure you could do it on the stove too. Times are what work in my microwave. Please use your own good judgment on times to use in your microwave. (In my quest to eat healthier, I now make it with light butter, light cream and reduced fat Parmesan cheese. It still tastes wonderful, but there isn't any guilt!)
PLEASE NOTE! This is an &quot;authentic&quot; Alfredo sauce recipe! Real Alfredo sauce *only* contains butter, cream, Parmesan cheese and pepper. It will be thin and there is no garlic in it!

&quot;Chaat&quot; refers to various snacks and to the North Indian cafes that serve them. 

Fresh fruit often is sprinkled with lime juice  and chaat masala.    

Black salt (which is actually a reddish gray), available at  Indian food stores, has a distinctive flavor that's quite different from sea salt or table salt.

This is a simple scalloped potato recipe.  Everyone has their own way of preparing them, and I guess some people will like it and some won't, but this method is very similar to the way I make them.  The original directions gave the crockpot cooking method as the preferred method, with oven baking as an option.  I have reversed this option, since I don't do much cooking in the crockpot.  I hate to leave any electric appliance on when no one is at home.","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picKlg7Uh.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picmDH8PY.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picH4phGr.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/10/2/picEtXOFk.jpg"")",Potato,"c(""Cheese"", ""Vegetable"", ""Healthy"", ""Weeknight"", ""Oven"", ""< 4 Hours"")","c(""5"", ""1/4"", ""1 1/2"", ""1 1/2"", ""1/2"", NA, NA)","c(""potatoes"", ""flour"", ""half-and-half"", ""cheddar cheese"", ""parmesan cheese"", ""paprika"")",4,25,332,10.5,6.5,32.3,260.7,46,5.2,4.3,14.2,,,"c(""Layer potatoes, flour, milk, and salt and pepper (if desired) in a large casserole dish in several layers, then top with cheeses and paprika."", ""Bake at 350°F for 1 1/2 hours."", ""Optional crockpot method:  Spray crock pot with non-stick spray.
